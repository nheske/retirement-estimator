* Historical year without replacement e.g. vanguard
* Historical year with replacement 
* Log normal

for i, color in enumerate(colors):
    print i, '--->', color
It's fast and beautiful and saves you from tracking the individual indices and incrementing them.

Whenever you find yourself manipulating indices [in a collection], you're probably doing it wrong.
